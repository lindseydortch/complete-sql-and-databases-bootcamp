## Optional: Setting Up Windows For Command Line
- Walkthrough on setting up command line in windows 

## MAC Setup 
- Mac has two ways of downloading software 
- You can have multiple databases running side by side 
- postgres and template1 are not seen - do not delete these, they must be thre to work behind the scenes 

## MAC Commandline Tools 
- The `PATH` variable is to tell your Mac commandline any new instructions we have downloaded, it tells your Mac where to find instructions for other software

## LINUX Setup 
- Walkthrough on setting up for a Linux system 

## Importing the Databases 
- Schema Editor is where we will do the bulk of our work 
- We create our database 
  - Then we go to File -> Load Dump 
    - This is called a dump because this is what is typically known as extracting a database 
    - This allows us to select our files to import 
  - Run through the load dump setup steps 
    - Do not select 'Execute multiple dump statements'

## Exercise: Imposter Syndrome 
- If you feel like you're not good enough, you're just not there yet 
- Use what you've learned so far and see if you're able to help someone 
  - Teaching what you learn takes you to the next level
